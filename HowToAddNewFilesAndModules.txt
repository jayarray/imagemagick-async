********************************
*  ADDING NEW FILES & MODULES  *
********************************

* Place your module in a folder with the desired or appropriate name. (This should be inside of "im_modules" directory.)
  NOTE: Your module will be accessable from a property with the same name as the folder.
  EXAMPLE: Folder name is "do", module is name "stuff". To access, call: do.stuff

* Determine what "ComponentType" your module is in order to load it correctly. It will be the first thing the loader checks. (See below)

  - Must have the following properties exported:
    a) Name
    b) ComponentType = 'import'

3) import specific:
  - Is any module that only requires importing very specific items.
  - Must have the following properties exported:
    a) Name
    b) ComponentType = 'import specific'
    c) Specific = Array<{name: string, obj: object}>

6) multi:
  - Is a module with multiple exports.
  - Must have the following properties exported:
